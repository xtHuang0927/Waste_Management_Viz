## Waste Management

05-619 Data Visualization Final Project @ Carnegie Mellon University

**Abstract:** More than 12% of the world's waste is produced by the United States, with 62% of waste discarded by homes and companies being dumped in landfills or burned in incinerators. This project was undertaken to 1) understand the waste management process and four methods of waste management 2) analyze MSW and its important sector plastic by these four methods 3) visualize the impact on the environment. Streamlit based on Python is used in this project to create interactive visualizations, and linear regression is applied to predict carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from waste in 2022. With the hope of raising awareness of waste management and promoting a cleaner environment, this project ultimately constructed an interactive narrative website.
